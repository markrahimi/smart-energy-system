# Smart Energy System - Backend

## Project Setup

### Initial Configuration

In the meeting we had before the Christmas break, we had asked about the frontend of the project and how to start it, and the professor said that to start, I suggest moving "assignment-3" to our own project and continuing according to the initial structure of that project, and we tried to move this process forward.

First, we moved the assignment-3 files to our frontend folder, and this was the starting point for implementing our frontend.
