# Smart Energy System - Frontend

**Framework:** Vue.js

**Language:** JavaScript

**Styling:** SCSS & Bootstrap (if needed)

## Project Setup

### Initial Configuration

In the meeting we had before the Christmas break, we had asked about the frontend of the project and how to start it, and the professor said that to start, I suggest moving "assignment-3" to our own project and continuing according to the initial structure of that project, and we tried to move this process forward.

First, we moved the assignment-3 files to our frontend folder, and this was the starting point for implementing our frontend.


We have the following entities in the backend:

- Users

- Device

- EnergyReading

- Notification

- SensorData

According to our initial planning and forecast, we decided to consider the following pages as the target of the front-end implementation. We definitely need services, components, and styles to finalize these pages, and perhaps changes will be needed during the work, which we will decide again and document.


## Pages
- Login                 # Index page
- Dashboard             # After Login (Menu & Charts)
- Users                 # Users List
- Add User
- UserDetail            # User Details & More Data (Devices, Energy Monitoring, Notifications, Charts)
- Devices               # Show all Devices
- Add Device
- Notification          # Show all Notification
